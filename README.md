# Customer-Shopping-Behaviour-Analysis
📊 Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data processing to insight generation and presentation. The goal is to analyze data, extract meaningful insights, and communicate findings clearly using industry-standard analytics and visualization tools.

Dataset
The dataset is first loaded into Python for exploratory analysis and data cleaning. After preprocessing, the cleaned data is stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) to support efficient querying and structured analysis.

Tools & Technologies
Python – Data loading, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and data cleaning
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Data storage, querying, and analysis
Power BI – Interactive dashboard and analytical reporting
Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation for project summary and insights



Dashboard & Reporting
-The Power BI dashboard provides:
-Interactive visualizations
-Key performance indicators (KPIs)
-Trend analysis and summary insights
Results & Insights
